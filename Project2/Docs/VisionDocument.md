## 1 Introduction

TCCart is a Android based application that will provide users a payment and rewards management system for a tea and coffee cart. It is intended to be used by cart owners to manage customers, rewards, and process customer transactions.

## 2 Business Needs/Requirements

The Atlanta Piedmont Park area has had an increase in gentrification which has boosted the number of young professionals with higher incomes. This has led to increased sales of tea and coffee in the area and a large number of either new tea/coffee carts in the area or existing carts looking to take advantage of the increasing momentum in the business.

In order to take advantage of this booming business, cart owners are looking for a way to drive sales and repeat business by allowing loyal customers to receive rewards on their purchases. To make the checkout process faster and to accommodate the trend of increasing cash-free payments, cart owners would also like to be able to input customer orders and process credit payments.

These businesses want an all-in-one application that they can use to process customer transactions and provide functionality that customers will appreciate.

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

TCCart will be an application designed for an Android-based device. The application will first be used for mobile checkout. It will allow the cart owner manage customers, orders and payments. the system will calculate rewards and discounts. The application will include functionality to interface with a credit card scanner and processor to payment for orders.

Secondly, It will allow the cart owner to add new customers, give them a customer card, and allow them to look up their purchase history or edit their information. It will also identify customers by scanning their customer card so they can quickly purchase items from the cart. Finally, there will be integrated email capability to sent customer order receipt, let them know when they have earned rewards and their status chages to VIP.

## 4 Scope and Limitations

The initial version of TCCart will focus on providing ordering, payment, customer rewards, and customer management functionality to the cart owner. Although the customer will be present, but the cart owner will be the person actually using the app. Therefore the application will not be provided to the customers and will not provide them any direct functionality.   
   
Based on our initial business client's needs the cart items will be limited to selling tea and coffee only. Also, the cart will only forward process the database maintenance (the Android device cannot be set to a past time and use the database maintenance to calculate the customer's rewards status in the past).
